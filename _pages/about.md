Hi y’all! I’m a Master’s student in Computer Science with a specialization in Data Science at [Carleton University](https://carleton.ca/), where I’m fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Wei Shi](https://www.csit.carleton.ca/wshi/). I completed my undergraduate degree at Carleton as well, earning a Bachelor of Computer Science with a Minor in Mathematics in 2025. During my undergrad, I had the opportunity to work with [Dr. Alan Tsang](https://people.scs.carleton.ca/~alantsang/) on a research project exploring Selectorate Theory in 2024.

Outside of academics, I’m passionate about endurance sports and staying active through running, biking, triathlons, and paddling. I’m an avid dragon boat racer and have had the incredible opportunity to compete at both the Can-Am Games and the World Championships in Ravenna, Italy. On the endurance side, I’ve biked from Ottawa to Kingston in under 8 hours and am currently training for my first Half Ironman. Whether it’s on land or water, I love pushing my limits and being part of a team.
